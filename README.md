# scRNA-Seq fGSEA  

A good introduction on gene set enrichment analysis can be found there  

https://www.sc-best-practices.org/conditions/gsea_pathway.html  

The demo consists in integratating (merging) datasets from two conditions of cells (control and stimulated by interferon).    
After integration, a fast implementation of the Wilcoxon test is performed by Presto to find differentially expressed genes due to interferon treatment and a fast GSEA is done by fGSEA to find the relevant pathways.

For the integration step, see  https://satijalab.org/seurat/archive/v3.2/immune_alignment.html
